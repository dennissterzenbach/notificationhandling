# notificationhandling

This is an implementation of a dispatcher table like way to handle and use notifications inside of a JavaScript application.
One goal is to make it easier to debug, when or who issued an application internal message / notification.
Therefore it uses a dispatch table and a defined, configured list of events understood.

It does not try to replace JavaScript Events and their handling.

This is at alpha stadium and considered a prototype, work in progress.
Please use this at your own risk!
